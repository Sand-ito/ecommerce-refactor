# ecommerce-refactor

Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my ecommerce app. 

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://aqueous-island-64727.herokuapp.com/)

This project was a simple refactoring of original code. Changing the frontend from Globalstate to Redux. This was pretty straightforward with pattern matching "out with the old in with the new" style of refactoring. I suppose that is how most people would define refactoring? The main pattern being importing from redux and placing that where Global state was and changing the variables to have continuity.

Anyways thank you for taking the time to interface with the app, and looking at my code!
